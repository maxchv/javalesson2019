    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>

    <h3>ACT 1</h3>

    <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

    
    <p>
        Two households, both alike in dignity,<br />
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br />
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br />
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br />
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br />
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br />
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br />
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br />
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br />
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br />
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br />
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br />
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br />
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br />
    </p>    
    <h3>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h3>

    <p><em>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</em></p>

    <h3>SAMPSON</h3>

    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

    <h3>GREGORY</h3>

    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
