    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>

    <h4>ACT 1</h4>

    <h4>PROLOGUE</h4>
    <p>
        Two households, both alike in dignity, <br />
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br />
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br />
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. <br />
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br />
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life; <br />
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br />
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br />
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, <br />
        And the continuance of their parents' rage, <br />
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, <br />
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage; <br />
        The which if you with patient ears attend, <br />
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. <br />

    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

    <h4>GREGORY</h4>

    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
